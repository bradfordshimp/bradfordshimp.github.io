        <h2>How to measure 3 types of churn. Spreadsheet included.</h2>
        <h3>What it's about:</h3>
        <p>Churn is often talked about, but just as often misunderstood. What should you be measuring for churn? How does it compare to other SaaS companies? Is there a template for this? This article answers those questions and provides a helpful spreadsheet with churn calculations.</p>
        <h3>3 Take-a-ways:</h3>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Customer churn measures customers lost over a period of time. It does not take into account the value of those customers. Unless all of your customers have the same value, this metric is best used as a simple bellweather.</li>
            <li>Gross dollar churn tracks revenue lost from both churning customers and customers who downgrade and pay less. This helps you see if you have a churn problem in a particular price segment.</li>
            <li>Net dollar churn adds in revenue growth from upgrades/upsells. High upsells on current customers can lead to negative churn.</li>
        </ol></p><br>

            <h2>Finding the source of your churn problem.</h2>
            <h3>What it's about:</h3>
            <p>Groove had a problem, they were losing customers as fast as they gained new ones. This is how they used metrics to solve that problem.</p>
            <h3>3 Take-a-ways:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>By looking at the data, you'll likely find big differences between people who stay and people who go.</li>
                <li>Red flag metrics help you identify at risk customers <b>before </b> they churn.</li>
                <li>Take action with targeted messaging to at risk customers.</li>

            <h1 class="pad-top">Two Ways to Reduce SaaS Cancellations</h1>
            <a href="http://sixteenventures.com/"><h2>SaaS Growth Strategies</h2></a>
            <h2>A cancel flow can reduce attrition, but only if you are laser focused on helping your users meet their goals.</h2>
            <h3>What it's about:</h3>
            <p>When a user cancels, that's bad. Win back strategies are wrought with problems. A cancel flow may be just the thing to help avoid that cancel. Ultimately, you need to be able to help the user meet their goal with your app. If you aren't doing that, nothing will help you control your churn.</p>
            <h3>3 Take-a-ways:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Face a fact: if a customer canceled it's most likely because they did not acheive their goal with your software. Trying to get them to come back if they haven't achieved their goal is not where you should spend your effort.</li>
                <li>A cancel flow should give your user a compelling reason to stay and remind them what they'll lose if they go.</li>
                <li>You are making a mistake if you don't have a follow-up strategy for everyone who signaled cancel intent.</li>
            </ol>
