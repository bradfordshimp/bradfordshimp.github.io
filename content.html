                <h3>3 Take-a-ways:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Spend more time on quality than quantity. One good post can gain you more long-term value than 5 mediocore posts per week.</li>

                    <li>Know when your done. After you reach 80% of what you could do with a post, you're likely done. Effort beyond that has diminishing returns.</li>
